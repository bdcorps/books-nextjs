You just need to be willing to break the rules.</b><br><br>At nineteen, I founded a software company with $119 in my bank account. Five years later, it was valued at $10.5 million. I don't consider myself exceptionally brilliant. I just realized something few people know: You don't need lots of money or an original idea to get really rich. <br><br>Now, I make more than $100,000 in passive income every month, while also running my own private equity firm and hosting <i>The Top Entrepreneurs</i> podcast, which has more than 10 million downloads. This book will show you how I went from college dropout to member of the New Rich. And I'm holding nothing back. You'll see my tax returns, my profit and loss statements, my email negotiations when buying and selling companies. <br><br>It's time to forget your grandfather's advice. I'll teach you how to be a modern opportunist--investor, entrepreneur, or side hustler--by breaking these four golden rules of the old guard:<br><br>1.Focus on one skill: Wrong. Don't cultivate one great skill to get ahead. In today's business world, success goes to the multitaskers.<br>2.Be unique: Wrong. The way to get rich is not by launching a new idea but by aggressively copying others and then adding your own twist. <br>3.Focus on one goal: Wrong. Focus instead on creating a system to produce the outcome you want, not just once, but over and over again. <br>4.Appeal to the masses: Wrong. The masses are broke ($4k average net worth in America?). Let others cut a trail through the jungle so you can peacefully walk in and capitalize on their hard work.<br><br>By rejecting these defunct rules and following my unconventional path, you can copy other people's ideas shamelessly, bootstrap a start-up with almost no funding, invest in small local businesses for huge payoffs, and reap all the benefits.","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"0525534458"},{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9780525534457"}],"readingModes":{"text":true,"image":false},"pageCount":288,"printedPageCount":290,"dimensions":{"height":"24.00 cm"},"printType":"BOOK","categories":["Business & Economics / Personal Success","Business & Economics / Entrepreneurship","Business & Economics / Motivational"],"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":true,"contentVersion":"1.4.4.0.preview.2","panelizationSummary":{"containsEpubBubbles":false,"containsImageBubbles":false},"imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/publisher/content?id=3i9eDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&imgtk=AFLRE71a70j5lXuGNdbIfhd1pOgcuTA4l6M8haC2DaHEeP1Kpa_oGp6iRMAO0MqKBC6tBiLBiXv4WnMvj6pf-_QT-_Q_B_ULigRnVEVTvalKuTEQRfEbyUcySsK62IqWJimW8jpbW5AC&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/publisher/content?id=3i9eDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&imgtk=AFLRE73ff4Lbcr0qkpr0AKkfSu8HW9GyksOUaHvSzYfAW3WdVpKKVVlSTEbpDmf7v7ppofuP6F99RRcFfllORD7Ce9QGtnoKJFmBQ0XR1CvYPVMdkM8JWUGY-Ta-5Kk1ZayGtWcDVG4n&source=gbs_api","small":"http://books.google.com/books/publisher/content?id=3i9eDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=2&edge=curl&imgtk=AFLRE72lcbGkkz3vZw53iczquE67hBm3ZjDzV2fg6F0DuHPDaDss3sfd9_rdIoy4NfyGkbJmUiaGGmC9vZsBk7S5BJrq_Lef9yiSmjg0K-L5SFLQDkXtr6bhp5k6ABvjNZiZYLxc3ne4&source=gbs_api","medium":"http://books.google.com/books/publisher/content?id=3i9eDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=3&edge=curl&imgtk=AFLRE71s18Dy--AUwpXEjb6EUNa95-X-QxnTIaVRdF5Rz1PvHkr7DWyYMfBgtKSilLyWluHHBv9PANOPjBLzCAfyBazljIf8BxTbBECHZZHk8m_aYlvoOSjK5Wp51MQs0jP3wwrOZtpC&source=gbs_api","large":"http://books.google.com/books/publisher/content?id=3i9eDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=curl&imgtk=AFLRE71u-p-dMI0Hapj4v3LXl1SlixKD2imo4Wz8-_bdcCbJhgcq41Z4paYWy20pn7xLqUw45okvfL36rUnLSu0BiYORGhYCB_zz6tRqgwwdPj9h2gpD2E58HANQwUYf7UjjkwHojULU&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.ca/books?id=3i9eDwAAQBAJ&hl=&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=3i9eDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=3i9eDwAAQBAJ"},"layerInfo":{"layers":[{"layerId":"geo","volumeAnnotationsVersion":"7"}]},"saleInfo":{"country":"CA","saleability":"FOR_SALE","isEbook":true,"listPrice":{"amount":14.99,"currencyCode":"CAD"},"retailPrice":{"amount":14.99,"currencyCode":"CAD"},"buyLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=3i9eDwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-3i9eDwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api","offers":[{"finskyOfferType":1,"listPrice":{"amountInMicros":14990000,"currencyCode":"CAD"},"retailPrice":{"amountInMicros":14990000,"currencyCode":"CAD"},"giftable":true}]},"accessInfo":{"country":"CA","viewability":"PARTIAL","embeddable":true,"publicDomain":false,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY","epub":{"isAvailable":true,"acsTokenLink":"http://books.google.ca/books/download/How_to_Be_a_Capitalist_Without_Any_Capit-sample-epub.acsm?id=3i9eDwAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"},"pdf":{"isAvailable":false},"webReaderLink":"http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=3i9eDwAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api","accessViewStatus":"SAMPLE","quoteSharingAllowed":false}},{"kind":"books#volume","id":"1IKPtglyfvQC","etag":"7lnABTiH0d0","selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/1IKPtglyfvQC","volumeInfo":{"title":"Will it Fly?","subtitle":"How to Know If Your New Business Idea Has Wings-- Before You Take the Leap","authors":["Thomas K.

Rather, he has a special genius for turning ideas into income, and he uses what he earns both to support his life of adventure and to give back. <br> <br> There are <i>many</i> <i>others </i>like Chris â those who've found ways to opt out of traditional employment and create the time and income to pursue what they find meaningful. Sometimes, achieving that perfect blend of passion and income doesn't depend on shelving what you currently do. You can start small with your venture, committing little time or money, and wait to take the real plunge when you're sure it's successful. <br> <br> In preparing to write this book, Chris identified 1,500 individuals who have built businesses earning $50,000 or more from a modest investment (in many cases, $100 or less), and from that group he's chosen to focus on the 50 most intriguing case studies. In nearly all cases, people with no special skills discovered aspects of their personal passions that could be monetized, and were able to restructure their lives in ways that gave them greater freedom and fulfillment.<br> <br> Here, finally, distilled into one easy-to-use guide, are the most valuable lessons from those who've learned how to turn what they do into a gateway to self-fulfillment. It's all about finding the intersection between your âexpertiseâ â even if you don't consider it such -- and what other people will pay for. You don't need an MBA, a business plan or even employees. All you need is a product or service that springs from what you love to do anyway, people willing to pay, and a way to get paid.<br> <br> Not content to talk in generalities, Chris tells you exactly how many dollars his group of unexpected entrepreneurs required to get their projects up and running; what these individuals did in the first weeks and months to generate significant cash; some of the key mistakes they made along the way, and the crucial insights that made the business stick. Among Chris's key principles: if you're good at one thing, you're probably good at something else; never teach a man to fish â <i>sell</i> him the fish instead; and in the battle between planning and action, action wins. <br> <br> In ancient times, people who were dissatisfied with their lives dreamed of finding magic lamps, buried treasure, or streets paved with gold. Today, we know that it's up to us to change our lives. And the best part is, if we change our <i>own</i> life, we can help others change <i>theirs.</i> This remarkable book will start you on your way.","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"0307951529"},{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9780307951526"}],"readingModes":{"text":false,"image":false},"pageCount":285,"printedPageCount":306,"dimensions":{"height":"22.00 cm","width":"14.60 cm","thickness":"2.70 cm"},"printType":"BOOK","categories":["Business & Economics / Careers / General","Business & Economics / Entrepreneurship","Business & Economics / New Business Enterprises","Business & Economics / Small Business"],"averageRating":5,"ratingsCount":1,"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":false,"contentVersion":"0.5.1.0.preview.0","panelizationSummary":{"containsEpubBubbles":false,"containsImageBubbles":false},"imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=2YeBy-RlgkQC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&imgtk=AFLRE72GvWSoLDTSVr_VJ3OUkk7mITA8sHMvBY3837ENqFyaho4cZszJKdTTj1ALI46Mvj5fZtBghZayqWLJ53lmb7ceA45r88Fo4gfIOHwCfFIxg_XHuhWdn1wwZrO48lKgLBqBGYJH&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=2YeBy-RlgkQC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&imgtk=AFLRE70Z4XEa4OrJGY_mqwk-DtuPqmnkd_96L-w-R7-VdaT2W9KmZlvORiNhETUtcp2vXYT_eaCaiW9rz-ZbLVSjYH891uoA3AHPS5c8YF7SXsDpA8F6l-U5BYFD_F4st-WNEXjqo8ih&source=gbs_api","small":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=2YeBy-RlgkQC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=2&edge=curl&imgtk=AFLRE73cmgrNBe6Kqwc9zoIwx-fBfFnvjgYEJR85WuGFAACpbGP7DkeHb5W5OmSfnjcCsNVQePuX9xne3mA9f3h_Ri_xXS7vk9CfUdbATIBdqGXqMuYWpVVFVTkmnnuJzmPOvF4gm5J-&source=gbs_api","medium":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=2YeBy-RlgkQC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=3&edge=curl&imgtk=AFLRE71YDYpBo1TPHsCQ09Cv_XxMFhSS8oUxZN78GAUO1oeJUzUI-tD42V8oqJqhPB-aatyGOMn97LODVUrHRNsAUjy2kE2vArD8QmiU_LDIPgaereoByzbDrOuxCVBgZDwemRbekwgM&source=gbs_api","large":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=2YeBy-RlgkQC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=curl&imgtk=AFLRE73DJz-Vl4HbHof6THSEOZC2frCdBsNiWZgFXjhB_07UqZWLT7wLhtRFciD0rzKWnKsKyUoTcNCctB8G8IqoleGapQuEfIYDLF2mPPpySre8-7Q6-Bm4Toc7uqFNv6g5-tHcjApw&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.ca/books?id=2YeBy-RlgkQC&hl=&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=2YeBy-RlgkQC&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=2YeBy-RlgkQC"},"saleInfo":{"country":"CA","saleability":"NOT_FOR_SALE","isEbook":false},"accessInfo":{"country":"CA","viewability":"PARTIAL","embeddable":true,"publicDomain":false,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY","epub":{"isAvailable":false},"pdf":{"isAvailable":false},"webReaderLink":"http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=2YeBy-RlgkQC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api","accessViewStatus":"SAMPLE","quoteSharingAllowed":false}},{"kind":"books#volume","id":"Gno3DwAAQBAJ","etag":"c7i5X/vEDQ4","selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/Gno3DwAAQBAJ","volumeInfo":{"title":"Build Better Products","subtitle":"A Modern Approach to Building Successful User-Centered Products","authors":["Laura Klein"],"publisher":"Rosenfeld Media","publishedDate":"2016-11-01","description":"<p>Itâs easier than ever to build a new product.

But many of those failures are preventable.Â  The Lean Startup is a new approach being adopted across the globe, changing the way companies are built and new products are launched. <br></b><br>Eric Ries defines a startup asÂ <b>an organization dedicated to creating something new under conditions of extreme uncertainty</b>. This is just as true for one person in a garage or a group of seasoned professionals in a Fortune 500 boardroom. What they have in common is a mission to penetrate that fog of uncertainty to discover a successful path to a sustainable business. <br><br>The Lean Startup approach fosters companies that are both more capital efficient and that leverage human creativity more effectively.Â  Inspired by lessons from lean manufacturing, it relies on âvalidated learning,â rapid scientific experimentation, as well as a number of counter-intuitive practices that shorten product development cycles, measure actual progress without resorting to vanity metrics, and learn what customers really want. It enables a company to shift directions with agility, altering plans inch by inch, minute by minute. <br><br>Rather than wasting time creating elaborate business plans, <i>The Lean Startup</i> offers entrepreneurs - in companies of all sizes - a way to test their vision continuously, to adapt and adjust before it's too late. Ries provides a scientific approach to creating and managing successful startups in a age when companies need to innovate more than ever.</p>","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"0307887898"},{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9780307887894"}],"readingModes":{"text":false,"image":false},"pageCount":320,"printedPageCount":338,"dimensions":{"height":"22.00 cm","width":"14.70 cm","thickness":"2.80 cm"},"printType":"BOOK","categories":["Business & Economics / Entrepreneurship","Business & Economics / New Business Enterprises","Business & Economics / Small Business"],"averageRating":4,"ratingsCount":2171,"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":false,"contentVersion":"0.8.2.0.preview.0","panelizationSummary":{"containsEpubBubbles":false,"containsImageBubbles":false},"imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=r9x-OXdzpPcC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&imgtk=AFLRE70sgxw-yFxYfvhn-ZoP5gFBPx5P9nDKkopnAjo5xs9o_H4cNj1wKsGJW_e0vH7brIA76Vfh3WusDqCnwF3oUVwWygCcgPapGkeqqCeLVjeG_0XTG2wbdubgdzoa-A1bHO6-8Zzb&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=r9x-OXdzpPcC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&imgtk=AFLRE72crzUBP2WK9SQTc8KUN5_QIP0fUl6o4IZ4k5XqT5vYzuqX6BmXAm4qlDiZUJIrW76uC55su0j09pUPjAOG0E1hOr_lIkuEcfqTktSic1VId7h65AZm4J2TtaGBYqchm986yk7m&source=gbs_api","small":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=r9x-OXdzpPcC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=2&edge=curl&imgtk=AFLRE72BoQpDxeWrCgFJjKu-2dAXew646lVvij2_y65wuxRKj4FzwohQfWwTWHo1od4RPiIaJifBmWMHz8hO4W5NDExyWEFb63dKYm4IycEn21OlhdI96AGnbBNFPgNnjIlHZUgwSZlM&source=gbs_api","medium":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=r9x-OXdzpPcC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=3&edge=curl&imgtk=AFLRE70sYQsTA-dIa1MPL0VzZ8mCO0Mof3Olq1k8XfHXZCgS5k7V6kffTHzeOCWn8Xc1O_jrexcYBD8cCPt3SZTYGLczTZAfoGjLa_nmR76-aQ2f4xyJWjYP0uJcPdp_Jnj97XVe7IO2&source=gbs_api","large":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=r9x-OXdzpPcC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=curl&imgtk=AFLRE70m-7z7fR-FTiwwxi1BZsRDd459PgugchYGd7Nmj139bu6YC3IHS9lDMPhW_gDhkMvbbecqqYYfC90sAg8RHuT7kOoEQ6cTFm5A-NKBrZR7hPcsfNW9FwLVR7ES_1Ku_r_TALZd&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.ca/books?id=r9x-OXdzpPcC&hl=&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=r9x-OXdzpPcC&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=r9x-OXdzpPcC"},"saleInfo":{"country":"CA","saleability":"NOT_FOR_SALE","isEbook":false},"accessInfo":{"country":"CA","viewability":"PARTIAL","embeddable":true,"publicDomain":false,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY","epub":{"isAvailable":false},"pdf":{"isAvailable":false},"webReaderLink":"http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=r9x-OXdzpPcC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api","accessViewStatus":"SAMPLE","quoteSharingAllowed":false}},{"kind":"books#volume","id":"Z5nYDwAAQBAJ","etag":"xrS9TQoz//s","selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/Z5nYDwAAQBAJ","volumeInfo":{"title":"The Mom Test","subtitle":"How to talk to customers & learn if your business is a good idea when everyone is lying to you","authors":["Rob Fitzpatrick"],"publisher":"Robfitz Ltd","publishedDate":"2013-10-09","description":"<p>The Mom Test is a quick, practical guide that will save you time, money, and heartbreak.</p><p><br></p><p>They say you shouldn't ask your mom whether your business is a good idea, because she loves you and will lie to you.

To do so, you need to woo, impress, and persuade venture capitalists to take a risk on an unproven idea. That task is challenge enough. But choosing the <i>right</i> investor can be harder still. Even if you manage to get backing, you want your VC to be a partner, not some adversary who will undermine your vision in order to make a quick return. <br><br> Jeffrey Bussgang is one of a few people who have played on both sides of this high-stakes game. By his early thirties, he had helped build two successful start-ups-one went public, the other was acquired. Now he draws on his experience and unique perspective on the \"other side\" as a venture capitalist helping entrepreneurs bring their dreams to fruition. <br><br> Bussgang offers detailed insights, colorful stories, and practical advice gathered from his own experience as well as from interviews with dozens of the most successful players on both sides of the game, including Twitter's Jack Dorsey and LinkedIn's Reid Hoffman. He reveals how to get noticed, perfect a pitch, and negotiate a partnership that works for everyone. <br><br> An insider's guide to the secrets of the world venture capital, <i>Mastering the VC Game</i> will prove invaluable for entrepreneurs seeking capital and successful partnerships.","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"110142737X"},{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9781101427378"}],"readingModes":{"text":true,"image":false},"pageCount":256,"printedPageCount":231,"printType":"BOOK","categories":["Business & Economics / Entrepreneurship","Business & Economics / Corporate Finance / Venture Capital","Business & Economics / New Business Enterprises"],"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":true,"contentVersion":"1.1.3.0.preview.2","panelizationSummary":{"containsEpubBubbles":false,"containsImageBubbles":false},"imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=dzl2je04zFYC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&imgtk=AFLRE71LWeG4r1edkJrABhs-2yv7cl_GvmaZfq-axnTdvsIz32pjDLf55PSTkMxwt4uABMk67ViI4YKq6KLcrpRpXm9tGj5r-B3DXH8KqWKM5vUx59bMoicjX1ImyhixVfyAEDflmSe5&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=dzl2je04zFYC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&imgtk=AFLRE73ZJW6-p0vUogt_3dix3OVDY76uNYAtT6wjXwhIdMtgkWd9xYR0YwOrKSBc9N7e7ovcmnxCHN9nv9q-6aMg-72Irha6zEak0-EKoJEGodzIm_xOOBLzc2zsbli2HEYnDoS1XdUK&source=gbs_api","small":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=dzl2je04zFYC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=2&edge=curl&imgtk=AFLRE73BNMpf03lSmYPNwaQl_eWYl3OPCZKMB0WvDCJeyyML-91jhYVmOxukbtYjaEzercFSn7zBoIZSO9Dki6nnITp-JBnmtFig4ZF-QJX-zeUHUdL9srBPAV_U_CYRKeWFN1eqpy_h&source=gbs_api","medium":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=dzl2je04zFYC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=3&edge=curl&imgtk=AFLRE73i-V1akojC6y8CTeOS0AjFRRUQ3ajuNJwAWRCBj64bDw6-kdjKPgNq9ylq_4GJQVq3JecfU_cK8CWkCpoFv4vJAPzQH0n49zCf-GEHfMiHH_RTzw2j8ynG98LDl1Os5WdeM31w&source=gbs_api","large":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=dzl2je04zFYC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=curl&imgtk=AFLRE70feNAZDm_AsghumJdMaF6xtEd3i4SN0bMnHt7wIrY5ChmUGH4CsQVYC3-1vBCcw2AXTEvabaXFy6LZTbVhfXBK_iQ_Kw7anjdEZl3OSmcuh4TEa1JJPny6pAlozuC3SSykQFUP&source=gbs_api","extraLarge":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=dzl2je04zFYC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=6&edge=curl&imgtk=AFLRE72T7AYwwxNZUgoTcMiCqAGnX0sTGR2wTLPE3giB1p3NIRhDUJ4p92SbWg5ziUDHkcE2e7Z3EtwANi3kheTJVqRGrZHN6acZ6yh9GR04vuC37qqJJCQyIeDRVTI83OholKd-2YX_&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.ca/books?id=dzl2je04zFYC&hl=&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=dzl2je04zFYC&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=dzl2je04zFYC"},"layerInfo":{"layers":[{"layerId":"geo","volumeAnnotationsVersion":"6"}]},"saleInfo":{"country":"CA","saleability":"FOR_SALE","isEbook":true,"listPrice":{"amount":14.99,"currencyCode":"CAD"},"retailPrice":{"amount":14.99,"currencyCode":"CAD"},"buyLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=dzl2je04zFYC&rdid=book-dzl2je04zFYC&rdot=1&source=gbs_api","offers":[{"finskyOfferType":1,"listPrice":{"amountInMicros":14990000,"currencyCode":"CAD"},"retailPrice":{"amountInMicros":14990000,"currencyCode":"CAD"},"giftable":true}]},"accessInfo":{"country":"CA","viewability":"PARTIAL","embeddable":true,"publicDomain":false,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY","epub":{"isAvailable":true,"acsTokenLink":"http://books.google.ca/books/download/Mastering_the_VC_Game-sample-epub.acsm?id=dzl2je04zFYC&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"},"pdf":{"isAvailable":false},"webReaderLink":"http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=dzl2je04zFYC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api","accessViewStatus":"SAMPLE","quoteSharingAllowed":false}},{"kind":"books#volume","id":"fX-azQEACAAJ","etag":"dzj4fx/8GrY","selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/fX-azQEACAAJ","volumeInfo":{"title":"Zero to Sold","subtitle":"How to Start, Run, and Sell a Bootstrapped Business","authors":["Arvid Kahl"],"publisher":"Arvid Kahl","publishedDate":"2020-07-03","description":"<p>Zero to Sold is a comprehensive and actionable guide through the four stages of a bootstrapped business Preparation, Survival, Stability, and Growth.</p><p><br></p><p>From your first idea to successfully selling your business for life-changing amounts of money, this book will help you become a world-class entrepreneur.
